    <h1>Introduction to theater</h1>

    <p>Theatre or theater[a] is a collaborative form of performing art that uses live performers, usually actors or
        actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place,
        often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture,
        speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are
        used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.[1] The specific place of the
        performance is also named by the word "theatre" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, "a place
        for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe").</p>
