    <h1>Home page</h1>





    <h1>Relative URL</h1>

    <p>
        If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of
        the file.
        If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more complex syntax to
        indicate where the page is in relation to the current page. You will learn more about these on the pages 81-84.
